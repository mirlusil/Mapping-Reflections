# Mapping Reflections
Python Poetry

This program uses the geocoder library in order to geocode places based on user input. It also contains a poem written in the comments, which seeks to push back against colonial mapping technologies and ways of understanding place.

This was written for the Creative Gesture Assignment for Post-Coloniality and Aesthetics, Pratt Institute, Spring 2021.
